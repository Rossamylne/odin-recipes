    <h1>Summer watermelon</h1>
    <img src="../img/watermelon.jpg" width="50%">
    <p>This refreshing chilled soup is the perfect way to use up a leftover hunk of watermelon that you might have hanging out in the fridge after last weekendâ€™s picnic. When blended together with lots and lots of summer veggies, a handful of fresh mint, a slice of bread and some simple seasonings, this gazpacho tastes like summertime sunshine in a bowl. And it is delicious!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cubed seeded watermelon</li>
        <li>Red bell pepper</li>
        <li>Seeded tomatoes</li>
        <li>Minced shallot</li>
        <li>Fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>Apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine watermelon, tomatoes, red pepper, cucumber, shallot, lime juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a high-powered blender. Blend until smooth, 20 to 30 seconds. Refrigirate for at least 1 hour to allow flavours to meld and soup to chill.</li>
        <li>Stir gazpacho before serving, as it has a tendency to separate, and divide between 4 bowls. Top with feta cheese and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
